R scripts for processing infrared camera images of crevasses in the Tasman Glacier

This is part of [Associate Professor Heather Purdie](https://profiles.canterbury.ac.nz/Heather-Purdie)'s research about whether [crevasses make glaciers melt faster](https://www.royalsociety.org.nz/what-we-do/funds-and-opportunities/marsden/awarded-grants/marsden-fund-highlights/2018-marsden-fund-highlights/cracking-under-pressure-crevasses-glaciers/). This research is funded by the government through a [Marsden Fast Start](https://www.royalsociety.org.nz/what-we-do/funds-and-opportunities/marsden/marsden-fast-start/), administered by the [Royal Society of New Zealand](https://www.royalsociety.org.nz/).  

In February 2020 an Optrix Pi450 infrared camera was set up recording regular images of a crevasse field in the Tasman Glacier neve.

This repository holds processing scripts to help view and analyse those images.
